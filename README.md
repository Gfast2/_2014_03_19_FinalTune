This is the firmware of Mainboard, which is used in Leuchtenburg Project.

This firmware control four Motors and fetch weight information from four weighttransmitter. This all happens through Serial ports, in which they connect them with each other by RS-485 networks.

Mainboard will also send command to a Arduino Pro mini, which directly control four power LED and an eight channel Musikboard, to control light mode (blink, candle) and Musik sound channel volume.

At the end of the project we add a new Musik board (same hardware factor, but lower firmware) in order to play an ambient Musik song seamlessly.
